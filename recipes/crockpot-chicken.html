    <h1>Slow Cooker Garlic Parmesan Chicken and Potatoesc</h1>
   
    <img src="../images/chicken.jpeg">
    <h3>Tender chicken and delicious baby red potatoes, a full meal in one pot!</h3>
    <p>Do you like chicken? Do you like potatoes? How about garlic and Parmesan? Well, 
        then this recipe is right up your alley. This recipe calls for chicken thighs,
        and even if you usually prefer white meat, I bet this recipe might change your mind.
    </p>
    <p>Fresh Parmesan cheese will definitely go a long way in this recipe. (Plus, fresh 
        Parmesan doesn't contain wood pulp. Seriously, google it!) Also, if you can't find
        baby red potatoes or just happen to have larger ones on hand, you can just cut them into quarters
        or eighths. Whichever you prefer. And finally, you're going to need a slow cooker of course.
        Throw this together in the morning and by dinner time, you'll have a full meal that'll make you
        love dark meat.
